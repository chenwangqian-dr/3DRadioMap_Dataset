# 3DRadioMap_Dataset
## A 3D air-to-ground radio map dataset

This dataset is generated using a commercial ray tracing (RT) software, _Remcom Wireless Insite_ (WI), with a maximum of 6 reflections and 3 diffractions. Simulation environment is based on an urban area of Nanjing Road in Shanghai, China. The region of interest is a square area of side 650 meters and the aerial transmitters (TXs) are randomly distributed with altitudes ranging from 50 to 200 meters. The heights of the ground receivers (RXs) are fixed at 2 meters. An isotropic antenna is utilized in the simulation. The waveform is chosen as sinusoidal signal at 5.9 GHz with 10MHz bandwidth and there is 3 dB noise to the receivers.

## Document：
**Shanghai_Dproj**: The simulation project of WI.

**radiomap_raw**: The raw simulation output files generated by WI. The number in filenames "A50"~"A100" represent the simulated emulation heights of transmitters in different settings.

**radiomap_processed**: The processed channel path loss data is saved in MAT format, following the same filename conventions as the original data. The storage format is (RX_coordinates, TX_coordinates, Distance, Path loss, null).

**radiomap_shanghai100tx_2.5GHz.mat; radiomap_shanghai115tx_28GHz.mat**: This two datasets are simulated at 2.5GHz and 28GHz, respectively.

## A visual example of the RT result

For a typical fixed TX-RX position pair, a visual RT result is presented to demonstrate multiple reflections and diffractions. The RT result illustrates the complex signal propagation paths between the TX and RX, including several reflections off walls and diffractions around corners.
